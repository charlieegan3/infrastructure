# terraform

This config manages the resources in other GCP projects running in Google Cloud
using Terraform.

These resources exists under and are managed by the gmail account since project
mgmt automation is not possible without an organisation/folders. All state is
managed in [Terraform
cloud](https://app.terraform.io/app/charlieegan3/workspaces/infrastructure).
